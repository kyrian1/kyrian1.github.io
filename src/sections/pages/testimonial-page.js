                            <p>We were very fortunate  to have Mo to work with us. We asked him to make some changes and recommendations to our website, and to develop a Web based client enquiry system for us, both of which he delivered on.
                            He was always very helpful, suggested ideas for us, and delivered on time.
                            Mo was very pleasant to work with, courteous and we wouldnâ€™t hesitate in recommending him to anyone.
                            We wish him the very best in his future career.</p>
